        <h1>I am a freshman at Brigham Young University of Idaho and I don't have a clear path of study yet, but am looking at Wildlife Biologist, History Teacher, Welding Engineering. I love dirtbiking, reading, playing the guitar and piano, acting, and researching history facts. I am planning on serving a mission in the fall of next year. I have been in 5 plays in the past 4 years and am working on two more that will be performed in February and April. My nickname Hades came from my most recent play in April of this year.
