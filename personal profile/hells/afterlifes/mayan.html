        <h1>Mayan</h1>
        <h3>
            The Mayans believed that there were three separate worlds known as the Popol Vuh. They believed in nine different layers of hell, called the Xibalba, the Middleworld, and a thirteen layer heaven known as the Upperworld or Ilhuicac. They believed that only the gods were allowed in heaven and that all souls were reborn over and over until the gods judged that they were too evil and were cast into Xibalba.
Ah Puch is the lord of the ninth level of Xibalba and is the god of death, decay, disaster, and darkness. He is also the god of birth and new beginnings. He is closely allied with their gods of war, disease, and sacrifice. Often depicted as a bloated corpse or as a skeleton, he was most often prayed for to ensure the smooth transfer of a soul to the underworld to await rebirth.
