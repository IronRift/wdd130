    <h2>Origins (2009–2010)</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Minecraft</strong> began in May 2009 as a solo project by Swedish programmer Markus "Notch" Persson. 
      He built the first prototype in just a few days and released it publicly online. 
      This early version — now known as Classic — introduced the core ideas: block-based building, an infinite world, 
      and a simple creative sandbox.
    </p>

    <h2>Alpha → Beta → Official Release (2010–2011)</h2>
    <p>
      Throughout 2010 and 2011, Minecraft grew rapidly as players purchased early versions and provided feedback. 
      New features such as Survival Mode, mobs, crafting, biomes, and redstone were introduced. 
      The community expanded quickly through YouTube videos, server communities, and modding.
      Minecraft officially launched as version 1.0 during MineCon in November 2011.

    <h2>Expansion to New Platforms (2011–2014)</h2>
    <p>
      After the PC success, Minecraft expanded to consoles and mobile devices. 
      The Pocket Edition brought Minecraft to phones and tablets, while the Xbox 360 and PlayStation versions introduced the game 
      to millions of new players. Each edition had unique optimizations but kept the same classic block-building gameplay.

    <h2>Mojang and the Microsoft Acquisition (2014)</h2>
    <p>
      In 2014, Microsoft purchased Mojang — the studio behind Minecraft — for $2.5 billion. 
      The acquisition marked a new era of large-scale development, cross-platform support, and long-term planning. 
      Minecraft continued to receive major updates while expanding into education, merchandise, and new media.

    <h2>The Modern Era (2015–Present)</h2>
    <p>
      Minecraft has continued to evolve with massive updates, including revamped biomes, new dimensions, 
      improved graphics, and cross-platform multiplayer under the Bedrock Edition. 
      The Java Edition remains popular with modders and long-time players.
    </p>
    <p>
      Minecraft has also expanded into spinoffs such as <em>Minecraft Dungeons</em> and <em>Minecraft Legends</em>, 
      as well as educational tools, books, and an upcoming feature film.

      engineering, and art. Its simple design, infinite creativity, and constant updates have kept it relevant for over a decade.
